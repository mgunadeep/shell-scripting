#!/bin/bash

### This is created to demonstrate the use of arithmetic expressions,--> It means simply doing math in bash.
### The syntax for that is...
### echo $(( Expression )) ==>> When you're opening double paranthesis, Bash understands...that you are going to do math.
echo $((28 + 3))

### Here You have to enclose the expression in double paranthesis with starting with a '$'- dollar prompt

### Bash can't display the float(decimal) output,as there are no data types concept here.
