#!bin/bash

## Start of the line in any of the bash script should always be a SHEBANG NOTATION.

## Apart from the first line, none of the lines are considered as shebang
## Shebang notatin should always start with #! 
## Here we're using "bash" so we used the syntax "#!bin/bash", if you're any other technology or different language like python, then it should be #!bin/python 

## Using this SHEBANG Notation, we are telling the system and the interpretor to use that specific language/technology to run a particular script.

## Your server would have java, go , python, nodejs, shell installed. ( interpretor )

### Now if you run the script, the system will come to know...which interpretor it has to use...through the SHEBANG Notion 

#### How to 'RUN' a linux bash script ?
