# shell-scripting
This repo is published to make novices more familiar about automation, using the shell-scripting. Shell is nothing, but an interpretor and its native to linux so it doesn't need any extra layer for translation, unlike other languages. There are different shells in linux like Bash, zsh, fish. What you use completely depends upon your personal preference.
